# WhatsTheWeather
A weather app which gives you a weather forecast for Sweden's ten largest cities. 
The data is fetched from SMHI weather data API, https://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/. 

How to start the app:
To start the app three files are required: index.html, Script.js and style.css. To launch the app, open index.html in a browser and enjoy!

Content:
In the beginning, you will be greeted by a start page for some brief information about the app as well as a gif for fun. 

To go ahead and get a weather forecast, you click on "Check the weather" in the menu. There you can start by making a choice of city and then choose day/time. 
After that you are met by a weather image so that the user can clearly see and get a sense of what kind of weather it is.
Below the image you get three different values: air temperature, wind speed and rainfall (min-max). 
You can then make new choices, check out other cities or just another day or time.

On the page you can also get help with contacting us developter of the app by clicking "Contact" in the menu. There are also the names of us developers.

This is version 1.0.
